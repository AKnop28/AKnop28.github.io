             <p>During the summers I play for the Hampton Cardinals. 
              My buddies and I started this Amateur team together so we could get our High School team back together.
              It's a competitive but easy-going league. The town shows us great support and we enjoy being a part of their community.<p>
             <br> 
              <p>Like I mentioned in my "School" page, I play for the Luther Norse during the school year. 
              I have learned so many valuable lessons on and off the field that will carry into my personal and professional life. 
              I owe a lot to the Luther Baseball program and will always support it in the future.</p>
