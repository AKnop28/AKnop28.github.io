<h3>Summer Ball</h3>

<p> During the summers I play for the Hampton Cardinals. 
My buddies and I started this Amateur team together so we could get our High School team back together.
It's a competitive but easy-going league. The town shows us great support and we enjoy being a part of their community.

<h3>School Ball</h3>

<p> Like I mentioned in my "School" page, I play for the Luther Norse during the school year. 
I have learned so many valuable lessons on and off the field that will carry into my personal and professional life. 
I owe a lot to the Luther Baseball program and will always support it in the future.
