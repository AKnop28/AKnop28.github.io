              I attend Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. I chose to attend Luther for the campus, the baseball program, and the "feeling" I got when I visited the campus.
              I am studying Business Management and am interested in leadership strategies and computer science. 
              I am a pitcher in Baseball Program and have played 3 full seasons with the Varsity squad. 
              I plan to graduate in May of 2015. I have mixed feelings about it, but that will every time you have to leave somewhere you consider "home."
