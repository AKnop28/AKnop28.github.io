<h3>Golf</h3>

<p>
Golf is my number one hobby. During the summer months, I typically play 2-3 times a week. 
My Grandpa, Greg, got me started when I was younger and we play together all the time. 
I think the reason I love it so much is that I get to spend time with my Grandpa. 
As I get older, I appreciate the maturing relationship I have had with him more and more.
I would drop anything to play a round with my Grandfather.

<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>

<p> 
During my Sophomore year of college I came across the problem of not being able to charge a phone or have a fan up in a lofted bed. 
I designed and created what I call the "Golden Arm" to solve my problem. After taking several business classes I began to think of making a business out of it.
During the summer of 2014, my Dad and I built 14 Golden Arms to sell to interested customers at Luther College. I have sold all 14 and have people asking for more.
It's been a crazy experience, filled with a lot of learning opportunities that include advertising to other people and creatively selling a product in 
our social media dominated culture today.
