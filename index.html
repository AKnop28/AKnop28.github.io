             <p>My name is Alec J. DesLauriers-Knop and this is my personal website. My favorite sport to compete in is baseball, 
                 while golf is my favorite sport to play as a hobby. I am currently in my fourth year at Luther College as a Business Management major.
             I pitch for the baseball team and announce soccer and basketball games for the Luther College Sports Information team.<p>
