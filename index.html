<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p> I've been throwing a baseball around since I've been able to walk. I played two years of Varsity baseball for Eastview High School and was named Captain for my senior season.
After High School, I decided to attend Luther College and in March of 2012 I was pitching in my first collegiate game. I have played  three full seasons and am currently getting ready for my senior season.
During the summers, I play for a small town called Hampton. The Hampton Cardinals are the main attraction during the summer months in Hampton. </p>

<h3>College</h3>
<p> As I mentioned earlier, I attend Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. I am a Business 
Management student and enjoy taking computer science classes as well.
My favorite part about Decorah is visiting Craig at the Sugar Bowl for ice cream. 
I've been there so many times we are on a first name basis.
